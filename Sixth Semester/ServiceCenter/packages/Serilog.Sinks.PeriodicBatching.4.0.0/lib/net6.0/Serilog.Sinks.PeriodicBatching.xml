            <summary>
            Manages reconnection period and transient fault response for <see cref="T:Serilog.Sinks.PeriodicBatching.PeriodicBatchingSink"/>.
            During normal operation an object of this type will simply echo the configured batch transmission
            period. When availability fluctuates, the class tracks the number of failed attempts, each time
            increasing the interval before reconnection is attempted (up to a set maximum) and at predefined
            points indicating that either the current batch, or entire waiting queue, should be dropped. This
            Serves two purposes - first, a loaded receiver may need a temporary reduction in traffic while coming
            back online. Second, the sender needs to account for both bad batches (the first fault response) and
            also overproduction (the second, queue-dropping response). In combination these should provide a
            reasonable delivery effort but ultimately protect the sender from memory exhaustion.
